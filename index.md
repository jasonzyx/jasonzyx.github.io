### Summary
My passion is to build world-class product with deep understanding on customer needs, state-of-art AI algorithms and system design. Technical-wise, my general interest falls into two categories below.

* Large-scale machine learning & optimizations, including **recommender system**, **supply-demand matching**, **bidding and pacing**.

* System/engineering-wise, I am interested in a variety of topics in distributed systems (that are served and commonly used in Big Data platform), including large-scale batch/mini batch/stream computing, online serving engine, distributed caching and storage.

### My favorite note (from Daniel Ally, Voltaire, and Jun Liu)
> Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers. -Voltaire

> Most people assume that they know answers. Their assumptions actually hold them back from knowing the truth. Truly, you want to ask questions to gain clarity about the direction you are heading. The fact is that many people don't ask any questions as they habitually guess their way by creating answers for themselves.

> To become a great researcher, don't answer your questions, but question your answers. When you need to know the facts, you must inquire, not just make assumptions. Many people don't want to ask questions because it exposes them to confront the reality of their circumstance, which may scare them. Moreover, asking questions forces them into the laborious task of thinking, which is why they fail to ask questions.
